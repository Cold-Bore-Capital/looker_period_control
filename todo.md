* "Last Data" start date is short by one day in trailing.
* Week, month, year to date seems to be excluding current day.
* How does time work?
* Period display seems off. Showing 2nd period when should be 1st.
* Create some sort of warning block that can display bad filter selection warnings
*  - You can make a date display block using your date between function. You can simply tie the
  date display block to your dates table, then run a min and a max function on the resulting values.
  This will display the min and max values in the range super easy.
